# Phone Number & Payment Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added phone number to user registration and integrated payment phone number for paid tournaments with prominent display on payment pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Models (tournifyx/models.py)

**UserProfile Model:**
```python
phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)
```
- Added phone number field to user profiles
- Used for contact and payment receipts

**Tournament Model:**
```python
payment_phone = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)
```
- Added payment phone field to tournaments
- Stores the phone number that receives registration fees

### 2. Registration Form (tournifyx/forms.py)

**CustomUserCreationForm:**
- Added `phone_number` field (required)
- Updated `Meta.fields` to include phone_number
- Modified `save()` method to save phone_number to UserProfile

```python
phone_number = forms.CharField(max_length=20, required=True, help_text="Phone number for payments and contact")
```

### 3. Registration Template (templates/auth/register.html)

Added phone number input field:
```html
<div class="relative">
  <label for="id_phone_number">Phone Number</label>
  <input type="tel" id="id_phone_number" name="phone_number" required>
  <p class="text-xs">Used for payment receipts and tournament contact</p>
</div>
```

### 4. Tournament Form (tournifyx/forms.py)

**TournamentForm:**
- Added `payment_phone` field
- Added `use_profile_phone` checkbox (default: True)
- Updated Meta.fields to include payment_phone

### 5. Host Tournament View (tournifyx/views.py)

Added payment phone logic in `host_tournament` function:
```python
if tournament.is_paid:
    use_profile_phone = form.cleaned_data.get('use_profile_phone', True)
    if use_profile_phone:
        user_profile = UserProfile.objects.get(user=request.user)
        tournament.payment_phone = user_profile.phone_number
    else:
        tournament.payment_phone = form.cleaned_data.get('payment_phone')
```

**Features:**
- Checks if user wants to use profile phone or custom number
- Validates that phone number is provided
- Shows error if profile phone is missing when selected

### 6. Host Tournament Template (templates/host_tournament.html)

Added payment phone section (appears when "Paid Tournament" is checked):

**UI Components:**
1. **Use Profile Phone Toggle**
   - Shows user's profile phone number
   - Fetches dynamically via AJAX
   - Default: checked (use profile phone)

2. **Custom Phone Field**
   - Appears when toggle is unchecked
   - Allows entering different payment phone
   - Help text: "This number will receive tournament registration fees"

**JavaScript:**
- Toggles payment phone options when "Paid Tournament" is checked
- Shows/hides custom phone field based on toggle
- Fetches profile phone via `/api/get-profile-phone/` endpoint
- Displays "Not set" message if phone missing

### 7. API Endpoint (tournifyx/views.py)

**New Function: `get_profile_phone`**
```python
@login_required(login_url='login')
def get_profile_phone(request):
    try:
        user_profile = UserProfile.objects.get(user=request.user)
        return JsonResponse({
            'phone_number': user_profile.phone_number or '',
            'has_phone': bool(user_profile.phone_number)
        })
    except UserProfile.DoesNotExist:
        return JsonResponse({'phone_number': '', 'has_phone': False})
```

### 8. URL Configuration (Main/urls.py)

Added new API route:
```python
path('api/get-profile-phone/', views.get_profile_phone, name='get_profile_phone'),
```

### 9. Payment Page (templates/payment_page.html)

Added prominent payment phone display:

**Features:**
- Appears between amount and payment method selection
- Large, highlighted phone number (2.5rem font)
- Green gradient background with pulsing animation
- Animated phone icon with ringing effect
- Clear instruction: "Send Payment To This Number"
- Conditional rendering (only shows if payment_phone exists)

**Styling:**
```css
@keyframes pulse {
    0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
    50% { transform: scale(1.02); opacity: 0.95; }
}

@keyframes ring {
    0%, 100% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
    10%, 30% { transform: rotate(-10deg); }
    20%, 40% { transform: rotate(10deg); }
}
```
