# Payment Approval System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a host approval system for paid tournament payments. Users submit payment information, and hosts must verify and approve before users can join the tournament.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Payment Model Updates** (`tournifyx/models.py`)

Added new payment statuses:
```python
PAYMENT_STATUS_CHOICES = [
    ('pending', 'Pending'),
    ('pending_approval', 'Pending Approval'),  # NEW
    ('completed', 'Completed'),
    ('failed', 'Failed'),
    ('cancelled', 'Cancelled'),
    ('rejected', 'Rejected'),  # NEW
]
```

**Status Flow:**
- `pending` → When payment record is first created
- `pending_approval` → After user submits transaction details
- `completed` → After host approves payment
- `rejected` → After host rejects payment

---

### 2. **Payment Confirmation View** (`views.py` line 1729-1734)

**Changed:** Payment status from `'completed'` to `'pending_approval'`

**Old Behavior:**
- User enters transaction details
- Payment marked as completed immediately
- User can join tournament right away

**New Behavior:**
- User enters transaction details
- Payment marked as `pending_approval`
- User sees message: "The tournament host will verify your payment and approve your entry"
- Redirects to tournament dashboard (not join page)

---

### 3. **New Views Added**

#### `approve_payment(request, payment_id)` (lines 1805-1904)
**Purpose:** Allows host to approve pending payment

**What it does:**
1. Verifies user is the host
2. Checks payment status is `pending_approval`
3. Updates payment status to `completed`
4. Creates Player record for user
5. Links payment to player
6. Adds TournamentParticipant entry
7. Generates fixtures if tournament becomes full
8. Shows success message

**Authorization:** Host only

#### `reject_payment(request, payment_id)` (lines 1907-1933)
**Purpose:** Allows host to reject pending payment

**What it does:**
1. Verifies user is the host
2. Checks payment status is `pending_approval`
3. Updates payment status to `rejected`
4. Shows warning message

**Authorization:** Host only

---

### 4. **URL Routes Added** (`Main/urls.py` lines 49-50)

```python
path('payment/<int:payment_id>/approve/', views.approve_payment, name='approve_payment'),
path('payment/<int:payment_id>/reject/', views.reject_payment, name='reject_payment'),
```

---

### 5. **Tournament Dashboard Updates** (`views.py` lines 1119-1152)

**Added Context Variables:**

#### `pending_payments` (Host Only)
- Fetches all payments with status=`'pending_approval'` for the tournament
- Ordered by creation date (newest first)
- Includes user profile and email information

#### `user_payment_status` (User Only)
- Checks current user's latest payment status for the tournament
- Used to show appropriate messages

**Context additions:**
```python
'pending_payments': pending_payments,      # For hosts
'user_payment_status': user_payment_status, # For users
```

---

### 6. **Template Updates** (`tournament_dashboard.html` lines 242-378)

#### **For Users - Payment Status Messages**

**Pending Approval Message** (lines 244-257)
- Shown when `user_payment_status == 'pending_approval'`
- Yellow card with pulsing animation
- Clock icon
- Message: "Your payment information has been submitted successfully!"

**Rejected Payment Message** (lines 259-270)

- Red card with error styling

#### **For Hosts - Pending Payments Section** (lines 272-378)

3. Payment status validation - only `pending_approval` can be processed
4. Tournament capacity check - won't approve if full

- Payment details stored in JSON field
- Transaction IDs tracked
- Timestamps for audit trail
- User profile linking for accountability
