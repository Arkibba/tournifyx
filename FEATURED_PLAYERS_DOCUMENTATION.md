## Backend Implementation

### View Updates (`tournifyx/views.py`)

#### Added Featured Players Query
```python
# Featured Players by Category (Top 1 from each segment)
featured_categories = ['valorant', 'football', 'cricket', 'basketball']
featured_players = []

for category in featured_categories:
    top_in_category = (
        PointTable.objects.select_related('player', 'tournament')
        .filter(tournament__category=category)
        .values('player__name', 'player__id')
        .annotate(
            total_points=models.Sum('points'),
            total_wins=models.Sum('wins'),
            total_tournaments=models.Count('tournament', distinct=True),
            total_matches=models.Sum('matches_played'),
        )
        .order_by('-total_points', '-total_wins')
        .first()
    )
```

#### Avatar Mapping
Each category is mapped to a specific avatar image:
- `valorant` → `yoru.png`
- `football` → `turjo.jpg`
- `cricket` → `Mahin.jpg`
- `basketball` → `shoshi.jpg`

#### Fallback Handling
If no player exists for a category, a placeholder is shown:
- Username: "No Player Yet"
- All stats: 0
- Category-specific avatar still displayed

#### Context Data
Added `featured_players` to template context with these fields:
- `username`
- `category`
- `category_display` (Title-cased)
- `points`
- `wins`
- `tournaments`
- `win_rate`
- `avatar_url`

## Frontend Implementation

### Template Structure (`templates/home.html`)

#### Grid Layout
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
  <!-- Featured Players (Left) - lg:col-span-1 -->
  <!-- Leaderboard (Right) - lg:col-span-2 -->
</div>
```

#### Featured Players Container
```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-500/20 to-pink-500/20 rounded-2xl shadow-lg p-6 border-2 border-orange-500/30">
  <h3>Top Champions</h3>
  <p>Elite players dominating each segment</p>
  <!-- Player cards loop -->
</div>
```

#### Player Card Structure
```html
<div class="bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-md rounded-xl p-4 border-2 border-orange-500/40 hover:border-orange-500/70">
  <div class="flex items-center gap-4">
    <!-- Avatar with rank badge -->
    <div class="relative">
      <img class="w-16 h-16 rounded-full">
      <div class="absolute -top-1 -right-1">1</div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Player info -->
    <div>
      <h4>Username</h4>
      <p>Category</p>
      <div>Stats (wins, points, win rate)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Database Queries

### Performance Optimization

- **First()**: Returns only the top player, not all results
- **Order by**: Sorts by points (primary) and wins (secondary)

### Query Efficiency
- 4 category queries (one per segment)
- Each query returns only 1 result (top player)
- Total: 4 database hits for featured players section

## User Experience Flow

### First-Time Visitor
1. Scrolls to leaderboard section
2. Sees featured champions on the left
3. Notices different gaming categories
4. Reads "Want to be Featured?" message
5. Clicks "Join Tournaments Now" button
6. Redirected to public tournaments page

### Returning Player
1. Checks if they're featured in their category
2. Compares their stats with featured players
3. Motivated to improve and get featured
4. Joins more tournaments to increase ranking

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Categories**: Pull categories from database instead of hardcoding
2. **Player Profiles**: Click on featured player to view full profile
3. **Achievement Badges**: Display special badges/titles
4. **Recent Highlights**: Show recent tournament wins
5. **Animated Transitions**: Add entry animations when scrolling
6. **More Stats**: Add KDA, recent form, streak indicators
7. **Time-based**: "Player of the Month" rotating feature
8. **Social Links**: Display player's social media/streaming links

### Technical Improvements
1. **Caching**: Cache featured players for 1 hour to reduce queries
2. **Image Optimization**: Use WebP format for avatars
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load avatars only when section is visible
4. **Real Avatars**: Allow players to upload custom avatars
5. **Fallback Images**: Better placeholder images for missing players
